\arguments{
\item{x}{Full sample predictor}

\item{y}{Full sample forecast target}

\item{roll_window}{Length of the rolling window}

\item{h}{forecast horizon}

\item{m}{number of folds}

\item{ntau}{number of tau values}

\item{train_method}{parameter tuning method for L2relax "cv_random", "cv" or "oos"}

\item{solver}{"Rmosek" or "CVXR"}

\item{tol}{tolerance for the solver}

\item{verb}{boolean to control whether print information on screen}

\item{csr}{boolean to opt out for the csr}

\item{tau.min.ratio}{ratio of the minimum tau in tau.seq over the maximum
(which is the smallest tau such that
equal-weight solves the forecast combination optimization.)}
}
\description{
The function reads data and make forecasts based on linear predictive regression
with diverse methods. It incorporates both short-horizon and long-horizon forecasting.
